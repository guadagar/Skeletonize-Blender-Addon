# Skeletonize-Blender-Addon
This repository contains the files needed to install the skeletonize Blender addon used in this [publication](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.15.435547v2). It provides an interface in Blender 
to the [Triangulated Surface Mesh Skeletonization](https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Surface_mesh_skeletonization/index.html) from the Cgal library.
It adds the ability to skeletonize a triangulated mesh in Blender. For cigar-shaped objects (as the outer membrane of mitochondria analyzed in this [publication](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.15.435547v2)),
the length and the average radius of the mesh can be also computed.

## Installation
This addon has been tested in Blender 2.79 and the skeletonize executable was compiled in a MacOs Catalina version 10.15.3.
